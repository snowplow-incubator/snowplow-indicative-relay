# Snowplow Indicative Relay
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/snowplow-incubator/snowplow-indicative-relay.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/snowplow-incubator/snowplow-indicative-relay)

Snowplow Indicative Relay is an AWS Lambda function that reads Snowplow enriched events
from a Kinesis Stream and transfers them to Indicative. It processes events in batches, which
size depends on your AWS Lambda configuration.


## Usage

### Code deployment

We host a jar file on S3 through Snowplow [hosted assets](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Hosted-assets).
For example:
```
s3://snowplow-hosted-assets/relays/indicative/indicative-relay-0.1.0.jar
```
You will need to use a S3 bucket in the same region as your lambda. The above URL is for the *eu-west-1* region.
Buckets in other regions have their region names added to the base of the URL, like this:
```
s3://snowplow-hosted-assets-us-east-1/relays/indicative/indicative-relay-0.1.0.jar
s3://snowplow-hosted-assets-eu-central-1/relays/indicative/indicative-relay-0.1.0.jar
```

### Creating the Lambda

Your AWS Lambda needs to have an Execution Role that allows it to use the Kinesis Stream.
To create one please follow [the official AWS tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-kinesis-example-create-iam-role.html).
Then create a lambda function with the created role, either through AWS Console or through the CLI.

In the *Handler* textbox paste `com.snowplowanalytics.indicative.LambdaHandler::recordHandler`

You will need to provide the Indicative API Key as an environment variable `INDICATIVE_API_KEY`.

Finally, add your Snowplow enriched Kinesis stream as an event source for the lambda function.
